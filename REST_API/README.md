Hi there!

You will find here how to get data from a api passing a token in the header, using the method get.

The 1st file (covid_rest.py) shows how to get the all data from the api, from all pages, and save it in a csv file.

The 2nd file (covid_rest_pd_dataframe.py) show how to get the data from the api and display it in a pandas dataframe
